I am starting my career as a freelance software developer, writer, and entrepreneur at heart. I am the guy behind this site and the author of its blog posts. I live in Charleston, South Carolina — a fast [developing city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina#Economy). I’m studying network systems management at Trident Technical College, and then transferring to College of Charleston for a major in computer science, but I always enjoy learning different things. I currently am looking for my first opening for freelance software development and content writing for websites — mostly for the clients outside of Charleston; I enjoy working remotely! 

I have a natural tendency for creative writing. My writing style is undisciplined and inspiration-driven. I enjoy practicing my creative writing through this blog and social media networks, while I regularly journal my feelings. I love to read books, particularly in the genre of poetry, literature, fiction, self-help, cookbooks, food, wine, health, fitness, and dieting.

Apart from programming and writing skills, I am a die-hard Bob Dylan fan. I am very passionate about music and enjoy listening to music in my past-time. I love listening to rhythm and blues, alternative rock, pop rock, singer-songwriter, and folk.

Even while going to college, I still continue to study calligraphy by following lessons online. 

I’ve always had an ambition to make my personal site — a site which can be a one-stop shop for my contact information. Apart from my general contact info and services, this site hosts blog posts, articles and my opinions on programming, creative writing, book reviews, music, philosophy, MBTI — and sometimes politics too (occasionally, don’t get scared!); basically anything that makes me happy!

You can reach me on social media networks (links are given in the sidebar). 

PS: Feel free to poke around the site and [contact me]({{baseurl}}/contact) if needed!
